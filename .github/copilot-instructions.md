# Copilot Instructions for Personal Website

This is a Next.js 15 personal blog and portfolio website built with Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Contentlayer 2 for content management.

## Architecture Overview

- **Content System**: Uses Contentlayer 2 to transform MDX files in `data/blog/` and `data/projects/` into type-safe content objects
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom configurations in `tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css`
- **Markdown Processing**: Rich MDX pipeline with math (KaTeX), syntax highlighting (Prism), and citation support
- **Multi-language Support**: Content can be in Turkish or English (see existing blog posts)

## Key File Patterns

### Content Management

- Blog posts: `data/blog/*.mdx` with frontmatter (title, date, tags, draft, summary, thumbnail)
- Projects: `data/projects/*/index.mdx` with similar frontmatter structure
- Authors: `data/authors/*.mdx` for author profiles
- Site config: `data/siteMetadata.js` contains all site-wide settings and social links

### Component Architecture

- Custom components in `components/` extend base HTML with consistent styling
- Layout components in `layouts/` handle different page types (PostLayout, ListLayout, etc.)
- App router structure in `app/` with route-specific `page.tsx` files
- Custom Link and Image components wrap Next.js primitives with additional functionality

### Build System

- `scripts/postbuild.mjs` runs after build to generate search index and RSS feeds
- `contentlayer.config.ts` defines document schemas and MDX processing pipeline
- Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit formatting (Prettier + ESLint)

## Development Workflow

### Essential Commands

```bash
yarn dev          # Start development server
yarn build        # Build for production (includes postbuild script)
yarn lint         # Run ESLint with auto-fix
```

### Content Creation

1. Blog posts go in `data/blog/` as `.mdx` files
2. Projects go in `data/projects/project-name/index.mdx`
3. Add project metadata to `data/projectsData.ts`
4. Images go in `public/static/images/`

### Styling Conventions

- Use Tailwind classes directly in components
- Dark mode supported via `next-themes` with `dark:` prefixes
- Custom utilities defined in `css/tailwind.css`
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Key Dependencies & Integrations

- **Pliny**: Provides blog utilities, search, analytics integration, and MDX plugins
- **Contentlayer 2**: Content processing and type generation
- **Rehype/Remark**: Extensive markdown processing pipeline including:
  - Math equations (rehype-katex)
  - Code syntax highlighting (rehype-prism-plus)
  - Auto-linking headings
  - Citation support
- **React PDF**: Used for CV/resume display functionality

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Content Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
title: 'Post Title'
date: '2025-01-01'
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
draft: false
summary: 'Brief description'
thumbnail: '/static/images/image.png' # Optional
```

### Tag Management

- Tags are automatically collected from all content
- `app/tag-data.json` is generated during build
- Tag pages are dynamically generated at `/tags/[tag]`

### Navigation

- Header navigation defined in `data/headerNavLinks.ts`
- Mobile navigation handled by `MobileNav` component
- Search functionality integrated via SearchButton

When working on this codebase:

- Always check existing content structure before creating new posts
- Respect the existing TypeScript types generated by Contentlayer
- Use the established component patterns rather than creating new ones
- Test both light and dark modes when making UI changes
- Remember that content can be in multiple languages (primarily Turkish and English)
