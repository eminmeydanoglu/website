Hi there!

###### I am Emin MeydanoÄŸlu, an undergraduate at Istanbul Technical University, studying controls and robotics engineering. Apart from my passion in robotics and autonomous systems, I am also passionate about physics, philosophy, and on how to live a good life.

###### I like to share my work and thoughts with the world. Here are some sources I created on that mission:

1. You will find various writings, project diaries in this website.
2. I publish a big chunk of my Obsidian vault, anything that isn't super personal, at https://eminmeydanoglu.github.io/digitalgarden/
3. I have a YouTube channel, mostly dedicated to philosophy (almost all videos in Turkish): www.youtube.com/@eminmeydanoglu
4.
