Merhaba!

I'm **Emin Meydanoğlu**, an undergraduate at Istanbul Technical University, studying **Mathematical Engineering (Applied Mathematics)**. Apart from my deepest passion for **artificial intelligence**, I am also fascinated by **physics, philosophy, and the path toward living a good and wise life**.

This site is where I share my work, thoughts, and ongoing projects with you. You can find writings and engineering project diaries right here on the website.
Also,

1. I publish a significant portion of my **brain** (everything that isn't too personal): https://brain.meydanoglu.com
2. I have a YouTube channel, mostly dedicated to philosophy (almost all videos in Turkish): www.youtube.com/@eminmeydanoglu
